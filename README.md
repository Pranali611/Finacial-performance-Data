Hello Everyone,
I made this Finance Dashboard in Tableau with the Finance Excel Workbook provided by Microsoft
on their Website.
Problem Statement
● The goal of this Tableau  Dashboard Project is to analyse the financial performance of a
company using the provided Microsoft Sample Data.
● To create a visually appealing dashboard that provides an overview of the company's financial
metrics enabling stakeholders to make informed business decisions.
